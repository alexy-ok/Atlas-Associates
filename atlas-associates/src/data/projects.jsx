      `This is a 2 story northwest-style house with a walkout basement. We use an open stair case and two-level entry atrium to create a grand entry feeling without sacrifice much space.
Open living space and kitchen and a large island that open to the greenish backyard. The front has a guest room that also can be used as an office. Upper level with master suite and library on one side and three bedrooms on the other side to create privacy. The basement has a guest bedroom suite and a recreation roof with a large window and deck to the back yard. Based on our researches of current luxury houses’ layout, we created this very functional and aesthetic house with a very reasonable construction cost.

      description: `<b>Exterior Environment:</b> The project locates in the Bellevue Eastgate area. The building has critical slopes with a buffer that limited additional building areas. We can only build on the existing house on the back. The original house is a very bland soldier house like we newly added entry and two-story lobby, we transformed the exterior look and make it looks like a brand new building. 

<b>Internal Space:</b> We opened the entry area and created a two-story lobby with open stairs that really increased the quality of space in this whole house. The main floor mainly created an open kitchen area and add another garage. On the upper level, we sacrificed one room to create a new master suite with a new building standard master bathroom with a soaking bath and a walk-in closet. Over the existing building, we added two more guest rooms with a multi-function room, which can easily separate from the main house, and create a separate mother-in-law unit with separate entry from the deck. `,
