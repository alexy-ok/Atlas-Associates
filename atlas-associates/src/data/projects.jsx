The highlight of its design is the multi-level atriums, adding an extraordinary spatial dynamic. The centerpiece is an open staircase leading to a skylight-crowned atrium, bathing the home in natural light. At its core, an open-plan living area seamlessly transitions into a double-height living room, anchored by a striking central fireplace.',

      `This is a 2 story northwest-style house with a walkout basement. We use an open stair case and two-level entry atrium to create a grand entry feeling without sacrifice much space.
Open living space and kitchen and a large island that open to the greenish backyard. The front has a guest room that also can be used as an office. Upper level with master suite and library on one side and three bedrooms on the other side to create privacy. The basement has a guest bedroom suite and a recreation roof with a large window and deck to the back yard. Based on our researches of current luxury housesâ€™ layout, we created this very functional and aesthetic house with a very reasonable construction cost.
