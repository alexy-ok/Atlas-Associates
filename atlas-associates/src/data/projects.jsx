<b>Building areas:</b> Existing building 3000 sf + Addition 1300 sf = total 4,300 sf (includes 700 sf garage)

<b>Exterior Environment:</b> The project locates in the Bellevue Eastgate area. The building has critical slopes with a buffer that limited additional building areas. We can only build on the existing house on the back. The original house is a very bland soldier house like we newly added entry and two-story lobby, we transformed the exterior look and make it looks like a brand new building. 

<b>Internal Space:</b> We opened the entry area and created a two-story lobby with open stairs that really increased the quality of space in this whole house. The main floor mainly created an open kitchen area and add another garage. On the upper level, we sacrificed one room to create a new master suite with a new building standard master bathroom with a soaking bath and a walk-in closet. Over the existing building, we added two more guest rooms with a multi-function room, which can easily separate from the main house, and create a separate mother-in-law unit with separate entry from the deck. `,

      `<b>Lot size:</b> 0.29 Acre
<b>Building areas:</b> 4 units, 1922 sf each (includes 600 SF Garage)

​<b>Exterior Environment:</b> The project locates near downtown Edmond as a general commercial zone.  The lot can be built up to 75’ with mixed-use buildings. Because of shared driveway easement and other issues, our feasibility study shows it is more cost-effective to do townhomes instead. But the zoning required a lot of grown level transparency for commercial space we have to work with.  We meet all the city requirements by creating a common green plaza between the sidewalk and building to form a buffer and give residents more privacy. Fully take advantage of the sloping site, we have a pedestrian entrance to the west and a vehicle entrance to the east. The clean modern look of the building really helps to build a new look for the growing city. 
<br/><b>Internal Space:</b> The basement access from the east only contains a two-car garage and bike storage. On main level access from the west pedestrian entrance, we have an open living room with kitchen and dining room. Upper level complete with 2 bedrooms and a master suite. 1300 Sf of conditioned space has a very efficient layout to meet a young family needs as well as retired couples. The convenient location will be very attractive to future owners.`,
