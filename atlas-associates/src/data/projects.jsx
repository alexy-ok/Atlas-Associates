    exteriorEnvironment: 'Located in the Bellevue Eastgate area, the project has critical slopes with buffer zones that limit expansion. The new addition is built onto the back of the existing house. The original home was a simple "soldier house," but with the new entry and two-story lobby, the exterior has been transformed to resemble a brand new building.',
    interiorEnvironment: 'The entry was opened to create a two-story lobby with an open staircase, enhancing the spatial quality throughout the house. The main floor now includes an open kitchen area and an additional garage. On the upper level, one room was sacrificed to create a new master suite with a modern bathroom, soaking tub, and walk-in closet. Over the existing structure, two more guest rooms and a multi-function room were added, creating a potential separate mother-in-law unit with its own entry from the deck.',

    exteriorEnvironment: 'The project locates in the Bellevue Woodridge neighborhood. The original house is very plain looking, we try to transform the look by adding pop-out windows in two kids’ bedrooms to creates interesting spaces for kids’ rooms as well as some character to the house. The grand entry canopy and large pop-out windows in the living room create a bright space and a strong character to the house. The addition to the backyard forms an L-shaped building that surrounds an open courtyard. With covered porches facing a courtyard that connected to dining, and two master suites, it helps to create an outdoor space that can be fully used by the residents. A strong connection between interior and exterior space is created.',
    interiorEnvironment: 'We raised the whole roof, opened the whole floor plan at the kitchen and living room areas, created two master suites on the back well connected to the courtyard.  Two kids’ rooms with a shared study space with a master suite to the right of entry as private zoom, vs left a public zoom of living room, dining, and kitchen area.  With a high and vaulted ceiling with a separate master suite enjoy its own privacy and outdoor living space.',

    exteriorEnvironment: 'The project is located near downtown Bellevue, in the Belred medical design district. It is north of Overlake hospital, surrounded by medical clinic offices. A large Merrill Garden senior living complex with 130 units is under construction nearby.

    buildingAreas: '4 units, 1922 sf each (includes 600 SF Garage)',
    exteriorEnvironment: 'The project locates near downtown Edmond as a general commercial zone.  The lot can be built up to 75’ with mixed-use buildings. Because of shared driveway easement and other issues, our feasibility study shows it is more cost-effective to do townhomes instead. But the zoning required a lot of grown level transparency for commercial space we have to work with.  We meet all the city requirements by creating a common green plaza between the sidewalk and building to form a buffer and give residents more privacy. Fully take advantage of the sloping site, we have a pedestrian entrance to the west and a vehicle entrance to the east. The clean modern look of the building really helps to build a new look for the growing city.',
    interiorEnvironment: 'The basement access from the east only contains a two-car garage and bike storage. On main level access from the west pedestrian entrance, we have an open living room with kitchen and dining room. Upper level complete with 2 bedrooms and a master suite. 1300 Sf of conditioned space has a very efficient layout to meet a young family needs as well as retired couples. The convenient location will be very attractive to future owners.',
